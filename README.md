Tampermonkey scripts for MTG/FAB/etc registration and SK staff


# Autorefresh
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/465537-melee-autorefresh

This script will refresh the melee data table on a tournament hub or tournament controller every 30 seconds. This allows a product manager to keep a view of the number of players in each event, or a scorekeeper to keep a view of the results as they come in.

# Event Name in Enroll Player Modal
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/465538-melee-event-name-in-enroll-player-modal

This script updates the header at the top of the enroll player modal to prepend the event name, as this information is not otherwise visible on that page.

# PurpleFox Export
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/465540-melee-purplefox-extract

This is a modified version of [Aurelie Violette's Google Chrome extension](https://github.com/AurelieV/gem-extract), used and adapted with permission. It runs on demand on a results entry screen to provide the JSON results data that PurpleFox needs.
