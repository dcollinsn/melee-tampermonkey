# Melee Tampermonkey Scripts
Tampermonkey scripts for MTG/FAB/etc registration and SK staff


# Autorefresh
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/464306-melee-autorefresh

This script will refresh the melee data table on a tournament hub or tournament controller every 30 seconds. This allows a product manager to keep a view of the number of players in each event, or a scorekeeper to keep a view of the results as they come in.

# Event Name in Tournament Controller
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/464308-melee-event-name-in-tournament-controller

This script simply changes the page `<title>` in the Tournament Controller to be the tournament name, instead of "Tournament Controller | Melee".

# Event Name in Enroll Player Modal
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/464307-melee-event-name-in-enroll-player-modal

This script updates the header at the top of the enroll player modal to prepend the event name, as this information is not otherwise visible on that page.
